# Challenge name
The Robot's Trail

## My solve
**Flag:** `citadel{p4th_tr4v3rs4l_m4st3ry_4ch13v3d}`

This challenge required us to inspect source/import the html text. Here it refers us to look into a text file giving us basic syntax to access the system. Here we have to change the hrefs of the decoys into whatever is instructed by each new path. We traverse the page as we could in a terminal and eventually get the flag.txt and go to /home/ctf/.secret/flag.txt as out final reference.
