# Challenge Name
Track 08

## My solve
**Flag** `citadel{add_vinegar_twice}`

The challenge's prompt hinted at Panchiko's album Ginkgo and subsequent track 8 being vinegar. Using the ciphered text and a Vigen√®re decode with the key as ginkgo we get another jumbled string which we have to pass again under the keyword 'panchiko' which gives us our flag. This was done on cyberchef.org.
