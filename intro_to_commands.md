# Challenge name
Introduction to commands

## My solve 
**Flag:** `pwn.college{c2D7vOWDATyr4auZsJ5yGfjmbP-.QX3YjM1wiMwkjNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{c2D7vOWDATyr4auZsJ5yGfjmbP-.QX3YjM1wiMwkjNzEzW}
```
## Incorrect Tangents I went on
None here, tested the whoami command in the above instance too

## What I learned
We are by essence calling commands which perform predetermined commands, such as "whoami" prompting the name hacker as well as hello invoking the flag. This simply just gives us a rudimentary idea of how to navigate in the CLI and bash
