# Challenge name
Chaining with semicolons

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{McQ0fi_HXgWmaCPnNQGP-duD7c_.QX1UDO0wiMwkjNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!                                                                        
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college 
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:

```

## Incorrect tangents I went on
None to report here

## What I learned
The semicolon is a way via which we can chain commands in the terminal, allowing us to write the commands in a single line in succession equivalent to completing one command and then executing the next in the shell. 

## References
None to note.
