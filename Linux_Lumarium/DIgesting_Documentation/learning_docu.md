Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wlDuMlkkb__GuWzCjGrbTGDIRfn.QX0ITO0wiMwkjNzEzW}
```

## Incorrect tangents I went on
Here, I had intially accidentally called the cat command assuming we were acessing a file, an error on my part

## What I learned
This module explores the facet of programming where we must mold already present information (i.e. in the documentation) to suit our current programming circumstances, this challenge was quite lenient and self-explanatory but documentation is crucial for a level understanding of what we are working with and essential for learning any software/program.
