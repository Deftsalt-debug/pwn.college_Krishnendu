# Challenge name
Appending Output

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8K6luXMQzL2gxNUh_rfsJtCgI61.QX3ATO0wiMwkjNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!                                                                        
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ /challenge/run > ~/the-flag
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : /home/hacker/the-flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] Good luck!

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called /home/hacker/the-flag. Checking...

[HINT] File descriptors are inherited from the parent, unless the FD_CLOEXEC is set by the parent on the file descriptor.
[HINT] For security reasons, some programs, such as python, do this by default in certain cases. Be careful if you are
[HINT] creating and trying to pass in FDs in python.

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
I will write the flag in two parts to the file /home/hacker/the-flag! I'll do 
the first write directly to the file, and the second write, I'll do to stdout 
(if it's pointing at the file). If you redirect the output in append mode, the 
second write will append to (rather than overwrite) the first write, and you'll 
get the whole flag!

\|/ This is the first half:
 v 
pwn.college{8K6luXMQzL2gxNUh_rfsJtCgI61.QX3ATO0wiMwkjNzEzW}
                              ^
     that is the second half /|\
                              |

If you only see the second half above, you redirected in *truncate* mode (>) 
rather than *append* mode (>>), and so the write of the second half to stdout 
overwrote the initial write of the first half directly to the file. Try append 
mode!
```

## Incorrect tangents I went on
I had initially assumed that stdout was a file under the home directory, this was an incorrect assumption and I immediately realised this misread and course-corrected

## What I learned
The challenge touches onto a more common implementation of output-redirection. Instead of singularly rerouting outputs into files, we rather would reroute all outputs by appending them into a *single* file that can hold a log of all the outputs we append into it and grep the specific one we need in the future. The appending is done through the command '>>' and concatenates the redirected outputs into the file. Note that it overwrites the file if we use the '>' in truncated mode, i.e using '>' again after rerouting an output to a file.
