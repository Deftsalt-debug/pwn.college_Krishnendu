You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod a+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag

## Incorrect tangents I went on
None to note on this front.

## What I learned
This is an amalgamation of the previous challenges into a gauntlet of us chmodding the /challenge/pwn file multiple times. This is the same as previous challenges, there is nothing to repeat about in this instance, just further practice with chmod.

## References 
None.
