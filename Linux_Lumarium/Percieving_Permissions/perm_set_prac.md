You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod a=r /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag

## Incorrect tangents I went on
None here.

## What I learned
Chmod can be used to overwrite a user's perms too, instead of adding or removing to a user, we can use the '=' operator in place of +/- and chmod will overwrite the perms of that user with whatever new perm we specify. We also learnt how we can chain multiple perm changes at a single command using ',' allowing us to modfiy an entire file's access id perms at a single line in the shell. This challenge required the previous challenge's prior knowledge along with the added knowledge of chaining MODE changes and overwriting.

## References
