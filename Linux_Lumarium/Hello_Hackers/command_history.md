## Incorrect tangents I went on
This was a misinput, out of muscle memory I have pressed the enter key thinking the history would have prompted some output.

## What I learned
This is a standard method of navigating in a command line interface and is essential in cases where we need to repeat intrsuctions and commands. In this situation git commands along with ssh linking would perhaps be often used and navigating history to prevent constantly typing out the phrases saves essential time and keeps a neat log of previously typed commands in the session, even after we 'clear' the termnial.
