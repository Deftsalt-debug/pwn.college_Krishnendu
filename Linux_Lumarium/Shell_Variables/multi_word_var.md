```bash
Connected!

You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:
pwn.college{QR18aLlIQx1Vh2B2gpQiwGZMm6t.QXwYTN0wiMwkjNzEzW}
```

## Incorrect tangents I went on
None to note here

## What I learned
To place a larger set of data seperated by spaces, we have to quote the assignment to the variable and it will subqseuqntly store the entire argument, including the space between.

## References
None here.
