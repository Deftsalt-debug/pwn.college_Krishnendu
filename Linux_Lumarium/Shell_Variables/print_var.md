# Challenge name
Printing variables

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8QrcfwPirrC-nxet-MDTb7H1AwK.QX3UTN0wiMwkjNzEzW}`

```bash
Connected!                                                                        
hacker@variables~printing-variables:~$ echo $FLAG
pwn.college{8QrcfwPirrC-nxet-MDTb7H1AwK.QX3UTN0wiMwkjNzEzW}
```

## Incorrect tangents I went on
None here.

## What I learned
We've finally got to variables. These are partitions of data that contain and store a value, in the shell they can be read by echoing and passing an argument of the variable name prefixed by $ to access its value.

## References
None to record here.
