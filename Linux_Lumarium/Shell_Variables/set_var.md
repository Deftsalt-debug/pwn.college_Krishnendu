You've set the PWN variable properly! As promised, here is the flag:

## Incorrect tangents I went on
None to report here.

## What I learned
Here we set a variable's value to a set value. This assignment is = to affix a value in a right to left order where the right's value is affixed the the left, that being the variable. We also retouch upon the $ operator which is only used in the accessing of variables in commands such as 'echo' and performs something called variable expansion.
