## What I learned
Tab is, in a sense, a real-time autocompletion of a filename. In cases due to a lack of precision where * globbing fails. Hitting tab during the input of a specific path or file autofills the remaining portion of the file. Allowing for a quick, error free passing of a path intuitively.
